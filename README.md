# Impactify
Got some spare change and don't know what to do with it? Impactify is a cross-platform mobile app that tracks donations given to humanitarian non-profit organizations, discover new organizations, and ultimately invest in the well-being of our world. The app also uses a cross-user point system that incentivizes users to donate with each other and remind them of the good in this world.

# How it works
Create an account with Impactify and get started! The Home screen tracks money, businesses, and points. The user can navigate to the explore, feed, or social page to learn about nonprofit organizations and view the profiles of other users.

# Installion and Use
This project uses `yarn` for its packages and dependencies. Run `sudo npm install -g yarn` if `yarn` does not exist, then `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies for the project. To launch the app, run `npx expo start` to build and follow the subsequent instructions.
